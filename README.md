# Manual Testing:
* We rigorously tested the patient token generation system within the Hospital Management System (HMS) to ensure it facilitates a streamlined
  patient flow and efficient appointment scheduling for doctors. Our testing efforts included:

**Functional Testing:**<br>
  * Verified the correct generation of patient tokens and their integration with appointment scheduling. Ensured that tokens were dynamically 
  assigned to doctor slots, optimizing resource allocation.
  
**Usability Testing:**<br>
  * Assessed the user interface and interaction flow to confirm ease of use for hospital staff managing patient tokens and scheduling.

**Integration Testing:**<br>
  * I have checked the integration of the patient token system with the overall HMS, ensuring smooth functionality across different modules,including medical history tracking.

**Performance Testing:**<br>
  * We evaluated the system's performance under varying loads to ensure stability and efficiency during peak usage times.

**Reliability Testing:**<br>
  * Ensured the reliability of the medical history tracking feature, confirming accurate and secure management of patient records.
  
  * Our comprehensive testing process contributed to the reliability, usability, and performance of the Hospital Management System, ensuring a 
  seamless experience for healthcare providers and patients alike.
